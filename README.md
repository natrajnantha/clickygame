# clickygame

The application would render different bird images to the screen.
The user would click different image each time.
The game would keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page would shuffle themselves in a random order.
